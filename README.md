Towards prediction of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Treatment Outcomes with Machine Learning and CyTOF Data


Predicting responses to therapy for patients with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
(CML) is crucial for optimizing treatment strategies. This study utilizes
machine learning models with mass cytometry (CyTOF) data from samples
taken before treatment, and at 3 hours and 7 days post-treatment, to predict
patient responses to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) at 6 and 18 months. By
comparing the scalability and accuracy of various machine learning methods,
the research aims to develop tailored treatment strategies for CML patients.
A nested cross-validation strategy is employed to optimize and evaluate the
models. Additionally, the models are analyzed to identify key biomarkers
deemed important for predicting responses at different time points. The
findings indicate that integrating machine learning with CyTOF data shows
promise in enhancing predictive accuracy, which may help in making early-
phase treatment decisions and improving patient outcomes in CML therapy.
Furthermore, the study demonstrates promising results in predicting cell
types using models trained on clustered CyTOF data, highlighting the poten-
tial for these models to accurately classify cell populations.
